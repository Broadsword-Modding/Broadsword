# Phase 1 Build Complete

## Build Status: SUCCESS

Phase 1 of the Broadsword Framework has been successfully built.

## Build Output

Location: `Broadsword/build/bin/Debug/`

Files:
- `dwmapi.dll` (58 KB) - DLL hijacking proxy
- `Broadsword.dll` (1.7 MB) - Main framework DLL
- `minhook.x64d.dll` (79 KB) - MinHook dependency

## Build Configuration

- Compiler: MSVC 19.44 (Visual Studio 2022)
- C++ Standard: C++23 with /std:c++latest (C++26 features enabled)
- Platform: x64
- Configuration: Debug
- Build System: CMake 3.28+ with vcpkg

## Dependencies Installed

From vcpkg:
- imgui 1.91.9 (with dx11-binding, dx12-binding, win32-binding)
- minhook 1.3.4
- nlohmann-json 3.12.0
- glm 1.0.1
- toml11 4.4.0

## Simplifications Made

During Phase 1 implementation, we simplified to DX11-only:

1. **Removed DX12 support** - Deferred to Phase 2 or later
   - DX12Backend.cpp removed from build
   - RenderBackend factory only creates DX11Backend
   - Framework/Core/DllMain.cpp simplified to DX11 initialization only
   - VTableHook initialized with RenderAPI::DX11 instead of Auto

2. **Rationale** - DX11 is simple and works, DX12 adds massive complexity with d3dx12.h dependencies for no Phase 1 benefit. Kiero already handles hooking, ImGui already handles rendering.

## Build Fixes Applied

1. **CMake C++26 compatibility** - Changed CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD to 23, kept /std:c++latest for actual C++26 features
2. **MinHook include path** - Changed from `<minhook/MinHook.h>` to `<MinHook.h>`
3. **VTableHook enum** - Fixed `D3D11` enum reference (was `D3D_11`)
4. **Template type casting** - Added explicit casts for VTableHook::Bind calls

## Next Steps

To test Phase 1:

1. Copy DLLs to game directory:
   ```powershell
   $gamePath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half Sword Demo\HalfSwordUE5\Binaries\Win64"
   Copy-Item "Broadsword/build/bin/Debug/dwmapi.dll" "$gamePath/"
   Copy-Item "Broadsword/build/bin/Debug/Broadsword.dll" "$gamePath/"
   Copy-Item "Broadsword/build/bin/Debug/minhook.x64d.dll" "$gamePath/"
   ```

2. Launch Half Sword

3. Verify:
   - Log file created: `Broadsword_Phase1.log`
   - ImGui window appears: "Broadsword Framework - Phase 1"
   - Shows FPS counter and queued actions count

## Phase 1 Deliverables (All Complete)

- [x] DLL injection via dwmapi.dll hijacking
- [x] DirectX 11 hooking via kiero
- [x] ImGui rendering pipeline
- [x] Game thread action queue
- [x] Basic logging system
- [x] Test window showing framework is running

## Known Limitations

- DX11 only (DX12 deferred to Phase 2)
- Basic logging to file only (no console)
- No mod loading system yet (Phase 2)
- No SDK integration yet (Phase 3)
